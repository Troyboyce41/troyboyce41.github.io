# About Me

Hello Class! My name is Troy Boyce and I am excited to be on this Journey with you all in CTI 110! I am from North Carolina, I am married with three kids, and I am currently active duty in the Air Force.

## Interests
Listed most important to least, a few things that I enjoy doing are:
* Spending time with family
* Going to the gym
* Gaming   

Spending time with my family is the most important and meaningful interest to me. I understand no one will live forever so I enjoy spending time with family whenever I can, even if it is just laying around the house. Going to the gym is one of my favorite hobbies because I enjoy the challenge it gives me as well as the mental benefits it provides. Last on my hobby list is gamining. I do not have much time for gaming these days, but when I get the opportunity I make sure I take advantage of it. I miss the days I could just game all night with no reprecussions, but I would not change my current life for anything.

## Websites I would recommend

- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - I believe YouTube is one of the greatest free resources out there. I understand it is easy to get bad, misinformation. But, typically, the community features such as comments, likes and dislikes, as well as the views will tell you a lot about the video and content creator. It also helps having at least some backround knowledge on the information you are looking for.
- [reddit](https://Reddit.com) - I believe reddit is another beneficial information website. You can get so much beneficial information from Reddit. You can easily join like-minded groups and find interesting, new information about the things you enjoy. Even if you do not join a group, it is a way to quickly view discussions about topics or questions you may have.
   
I believe scrutinizing everything you see on the web that does not come from official sources. These two informational resources can have a lot of misinformation on them. However, they can also prove to be very useful. Normally, when I get information from these resources, I try to fact check them and find the information somewhere else.
