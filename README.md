#**About** Me

Hello Class! My name is Troy Boyce and I am excited to be on this Journey with you all in CTI 110! I am from North Carolina, I am married with three kids, and I am currently active duty in the Air Force.

##Interests
A few things that I enjoy doing are:
* Spending time with family
* Going to the gym
* Gaming 
Spending time with my family is the most important and meaningful interest to me. I understand no one will live forever so I enjoy spending time with family whenever I can, even if it is just laying around the house. Going to the gym is one of my favorite hobbies because I enjoy the challenge it gives me as well as the mental benefits it provides. Last on my hobby list is gamining. I do not have much time for gaming these days, but when I get the opportunity I make sure I take advantage of it. I miss the days I could just game all night with no reprecussions, but I would not change my current life for anything.
